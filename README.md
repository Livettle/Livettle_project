A Flutter project developed to recommend movies based on sentiment analysis.

In this academic project, we have tried to analyze user's current mood in order to recommend movies.

Movies are web scrapped using Imdb dataset.

A flask API is used to connect dataset and the application.

Moreover, CNN machine learning concepts have been applied to create the sentiment detection model.

As future enhancements,
    we suppose to develop the favourites page
    and some other features to improve the user friendliness.
